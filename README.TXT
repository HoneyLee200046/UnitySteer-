Steering behaviors for Unity, initially based on OpenSteer. Please read 
License.txt before using in your projects.

If you're looking for a specific version, you can look at the project tags:

https://github.com/ricardojmendez/UnitySteer/tree/v2.0.0
https://github.com/ricardojmendez/UnitySteer/tree/v2.1

Assume that any code not on master branch is most definitely not ready for 
prime time.   That goes double for code on the experimental branch, where 
approaches are likely to change from one day to another.

WARNING: Since this version uses Linq for some of its queries, it may not
work on Unity iOS due to Unity's AOT limitations.
