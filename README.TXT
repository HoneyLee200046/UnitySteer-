OpenSteer-based implementation of steering behavios for Unity. Please read 
License.txt before using in your projects.

Assume that any code not on master branch is likely to be broken, and
most definitely not ready for prime time.  As this point I am re-tooling the
components to turn everything into discrete MonoBehaviors, partly as an 
experiment.
